AtteWhen I ran the app, it gives you build errors pop up. In the Errors list I get these errors:

CS1002 ;expected , File TipCalculator.cs
To fix the TipCalculator.cs, I add a semicolon here. return tip;
CS0161 'HomeController.Index()':not all code paths return a value, File HomeController.cs
To fix this line we need to add a return value. I added return View(); and was finally able to get the solution to run.
CS0103 The name 'Viewbag' does not exist in the current context, File HomeController.cs
To fix this you needed to change Viewbag to ViewBag. Names are case sensitive. ViewBag.TwentyFive = 0;
"widht" is not a known CSS property name. File site.css

After getting the app to run, I get these errors on the internal server error page.

line 15 @ViewBag.Fifteem.ToString("c2")
line 6

Both of these errors refer to the Index.cshtml file

The Index.cshtml file has a couple other spelling errors:
  <label>@ViewBag.**Twety**.ToString("c2")</label>  
   <label>@ViewBag.**TwentyFeve**.ToString("c2")</label> 

I set a breakpoint at the var tip = MealCost.Value * percent; and saw that the calculation was dividing the percent instead of multiplying. I changed the line var tip = MealCost.Value / percent; to var tip = MealCost.Value * percent;
The css error was easy enough to fix using Developer Tools on chrome. We just needed to correct widht to width
